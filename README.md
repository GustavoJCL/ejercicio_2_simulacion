## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

## Prerequisites

- Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Pnpm (https://pnpm.io/)

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
